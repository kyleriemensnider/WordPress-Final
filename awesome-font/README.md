This plugin lets you easily implement typography into your WordPress site

== Description ==


I would like to make a plugin that pulls from Google Fonts API and gives a visual sample of each font that they have available. From the list of samples the user can choose to asign the fonts to certain tags like <p>, <h1> - <h6>, <li>, <a>, etc. 

A few notes about the sections above:

*   "Contributors" is a comma separated list of wp.org/wp-plugins.org usernames
*   "Tags" is a comma separated list of tags that apply to the plugin
*   "Requires at least" is the lowest version that the plugin will work on
*   "Tested up to" is the highest version that you've *successfully used to test the plugin*. Note that it might work on
higher versions... this is just the highest one you've verified.
*   Stable tag should indicate the Subversion "tag" of the latest stable version, or "trunk," if you use `/trunk/` for
stable.

== Installation ==

This section describes how to install the plugin and get it working.



1. Upload `awesome-plugin.php` to the `/wp-content/plugins/` directory
1. Activate the plugin through the 'Plugins' menu in WordPress
1. Place `<?php do_action('awesome_hook'); ?>` in your templates

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

Why would I use this
It gives the user the benfit of seeing a sample of the fonts on the admin side before choosing where they would like them to be on the main site. It also take away the problem of adding typography for people that dont know how to code CSS.

            "Markdown is what the parser uses to process much of the readme file"

Markdown uses email style notation for blockquotes and I've been told:
> Asterisks for *emphasis*. Double it up  for **strong**.

`<?php code(); // goes in backticks ?>`
